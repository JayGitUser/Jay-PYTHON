I created a small GUI to use YouTube API to download videos

The first issue was simply trying to download the video itself.
After looking at the documentation I realized I was using a YouTube Class incorrectly.
I put the YouTube("LINK") inside of a variable and did nothing with that variable.
YouTube class itself can download whatever link you put inside.

I built a function that would take user data and attempt to download the video and was successful.
A new problem as rose as a result. I was able to download the video but the quality is very bad.
I added a filtering to the code to look for 1080p and download that. Success!

The downloaded video was in pristine HD but there was no audio?

Why is that?


Well according to the documentation....

"You may notice that some streams listed have both a video codec and audio codec, while others have just video or just audio, 
this is a result of YouTube supporting a streaming technique called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH)"


The question how do we deal with this issue of having audio and video split?
	I willl have to merge them back together using something like FFMPEG software

Another issue was raised, how to deal with the downloading function only downloading 1 video?
	Renaming the file post download should allow the function to download the same video twice
	Instead I just moved the file into a different folder therefore allowing the program to download 2 of the same videos if need be


Added error handling for videos blocked, removed, or invalid URLs or wrong string type

Now wanting to add gui to program using pysimgplegui library

Lastly, converted PY file type into .EXE making it usable on any desktop!
